    <p>Delicious Japanese Curry, made with Beef, carrots, potatoes, served with rice on the side.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g diced beef</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized carrot, peeled and roll cut.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger & garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree (or ketchup)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 apple, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>500ml beef stock (or vegetable stock)</li>
        <li>500ml water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>300g russet potatoes, halved</li>
        <li>250ml coconut cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter to add at the end of cooking (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>1 box Japanese curry roux</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat a frying pan with 2tbsp of veg oil, add sliced onions and cook on medium heat until soft and slightly caramelised.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                In the meantime coat each piece of diced beef in plain flour. Use a bowl for dipping, and place on a plate ready for searing.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once onions are ready transfer them into a large pot and use the frying pan for the beef. Add a little bit more oil and turn up the heat to high. 
                Once the frying pan gets hot, place each piece of beef on the pan with the space between the pieces (do not overcrowd the pan). 
                Fry on both sides until browned then transfer to a master pot (do it in two batches).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Now use the same frying pan to slightly brown carrots for 5 minutes, then add 1tbsp ginger & garlic paste and 1tbsp of Japanese curry powder. 
                Reduce the heat to medium and cook until fragrant (1-2minutes) then transfer to master pot.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Bring the master pot on medium heat and add 1tbsp of tomato puree, 1/2 of grated apple, 500ml of beef stock, 500ml of water and 1tbsp Worcestershire sauce (everything should be submerged, if not add more water) 
                bring to the boil then reduce to simmer, cover with a lid and slow-cook for 1,5 hours.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once the beef is almost tender add cut potatoes and continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once potatoes are cooked, add half a box of Japanese curry roux, and keep stirring until the sauce thickens (After a couple of minutes add more roux if needed).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                When all the roux is incorporated and the sauce is thick add 1tbsp of Mirin, 1tsp of honey and half the amount of coconut cream. 
                check the flavour and add more cream if needed to balance the saltiness.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Mix in a 1tbsp of butter to finish and serve straight away, if you like stronger curry flavour add more curry powder.
                I also like to add a little bit of chilli powder to bring the heat.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
