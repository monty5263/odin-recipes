    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the slow cooker beef stew: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Salt and pepper the beef and dust with flour. 
            Add beef to the skillet and sear on each side for 2-3 minutes. Set beef aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Add a bit of red wine to the skillet and scrape down the brown bits on the side. 
            Allow it to simmer and reduce and slowly add beef broth and tomato paste. Whisk well and add the sauce to the slow cooker.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Add beef, potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, onion, and garlic to the slow cooker. Season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and add the bay leaf. 
            Add red wine, give a good stir, cover and cook on low until beef is fork-tender for 8-10 hours or high for 6-8 hours. 
            Garnish with fresh parsley and serve the slow cooker beef stew immediately. Enjoy!
